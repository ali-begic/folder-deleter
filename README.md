# Folder Deleter

The Folder Deleter application simplifies the process of removing folders by automating their deletion across multiple directories. Designed to handle situations where a folder with the same name exists in various locations, including nested subdirectories and hidden folders, this tool allows users to specify a parent directory and efficiently delete all instances of the specified folder. With options to include or exclude hidden folders, this application ensures thorough and flexible folder management, saving time and effort compared to manual deletion.
